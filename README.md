# Satire

Intelligent mocking (of http endpoints) with a purpose.

## Install

Satire is intended to be installed as a development dependency.

~~~bash
npm install --save-dev satire
~~~

Installing Satire as a dependency allows using the javascript API or the `satire` CLI - if `./node_modules/.bin` is in your `PATH`. It also ensures that your project uses the version of `satire` it is intended to.

However, the `satire` CLI can also be installed globally.

~~~bash
npm install -g satire
~~~

## Features

+ emits events when requests are received and responses are sent
+ file-based responses (particularly for GET requests)
+ other HTTP methods supported through modules
+ auto-reload when mock files change
+ optional proxy to actual APIs

## Use

Satire provides a javascript API and a command line interface. Both may be configured using command line arguments, environment variables, properties in `package.json`, and `.${name}-rc` files (using [configr8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/configr8)). In addition, settings can be passed directly to the javascript API.

### Settings

#### port

**type:** `Integer`

**default:** `0`

The port you would like `satire` to listen on. `0` will select an open port. Positive integers will attempt to listen on the specified port. Negative integers will prevent `satire` from attempting to automatically start listening.

#### mocks

**type:** `String`, `Object` or `Array` of the same

**default:** `['./mocks/**/*', './test/mocks/**/*']`

If a `String`, a glob pattern indicating where mock definitions can be found on the file system.

If an `Object`, it must contain a `path` key indicating the URI to respond to and a `mock` key containing a [mock definition](#mock-definition).

#### watch

**type:** `Boolean`|`String`|`Object`|`Function`

**default:** true

Indicates whether and how to watch the mocks found on the filesystem for changes.

If `false`, just load the mock definitions on startup and do not watch for changes.

If `true`, use the included filesystem watcher to watch for changes.

If a `String`, attempt to `require()` the module the string specifies. This module should export a `Function` watcher.

If an `Object`, attempt to `require()` the module specified by the `module` property and `bind()` any arguments in an `Array` under the `args` property to the `Function` returned by the module. The result should be a `Function` watcher.

If a `Function`, it should have the signature `makeWatcher(mockGlobs)`. `mockGlobs` will be an `Array`. The function should return an `EventEmitter` which emits these events:

+ `.on('all', eventType, filepath)` - indicates that a mock definition on the filesystem has been added, updated, or removed. The mock definition will then be loaded or reloaded. If it doesn't exist, it will be removed.
+ `.on('error', error)` - indicates that the watcher encountered an error. The error will be re-emitted on the satire http server.
+ `.on('ready')` - indicates that the watcher is finished reporting (via `all`) the mock definitions found on the filesystem.

Additionally, the returned `EventEmitter` should have a `.close()` method which will cause the watcher to stop watching the filesystem for changes and allow the process to potentially exit.

#### proxyAPIs

**type:** `Object`

**default:** undefined

Keys that begin with a `"/"` will be used to create a `RegExp` that searches for the key at the begining or the request URL. The first such `pattern` to match will be used. The value of this key should be a `template` used to create the target URL for the proxy using [`requestUrl.replace(pattern, template)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/replace).

Proxy APIs have a lower priority than any mock definitions that would match the same url.

### Javascript API

#### satire(options)

Satire exports a function to allow it to be used within your javascript program. This function will return a standard Node http server which has been set up to handle requests.

##### options

###### argv

**type:** Boolean

**default:** `true`

Indicates whether or not Satire should read configuration settings from `process.argv`

###### name

**type:** String

**default:** `"satire"`

A configuration name used to look up settings in environment variables, properties in `package.json`, and `.${name}-rc` files (using [configr8](https://www.npmjs.com/package/configr8)).

###### settings

**type:** Object

**default:** `undefined`

A set of configuration overrides to apply. These will override any settings found through other means.

~~~javascript
const satire = require('satire');

const server = satire({
	argv: true,
	name: 'my-satire-mocks',
	settings: {
	  port: 5050,
	  mocks: './mocks/**/*'
	  // ...
	}
})
  .on('mock-globs', (globs) => console.log(`Mock globs: ${JSON.stringify(globs, null, 2)}`) )
  .on('listening', (err) => {
    const {
      port
    } = server.address();
    console.log(`Listening on ${port}`);
  })
  .on('mock-start', ({ req, res }) => {
    const start = process.hrtime();
    console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);

    res.on('mock-end', ({ type, req, res }) => {
      const [sec, nano] = process.hrtime(start);
      const duration = `${sec}s ${nano/1000000}ms`;
      if (type !== 'finish') {
        console.warn(`WARN: ${req.method} ${req.url} was closed after ${duration}`);
      } else {
        console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url} in ${duration}`);
      }
    });
  })
  .on('error', (err) => {
    console.error('\n\nERROR:', err);
    process.exit(1);
  });

### Command Line

~~~bash
$ satire --port 5050 --mocks "./test/mocks/**/*"
~~~

<a name="mock-definition"></a>
### Mock Definitions

Mock definitions in javascript take 1 of 4 forms:

+ a `Function` that takes an options argument with `url`, `location`, `request`, and `response` properties
+ a "mock descriptor" - an `Object` with ONLY `request` and `response` keys
+ anything that can `JSON.stringify()`
+ an `Array` containing any of the above

Mock definitions on the filesystem may be:

+ a Common JS module that exports one of the above javascript mock definitions
+ a `.json` file which will `JSON.parse()` to one of the above definitions
+ ANY file, the binary contents of which will be loaded in to a "mock descriptor" object matching a GET request and supplying a content-type header (based on the file extention) and response body containing the data.

The standard "mock descriptor" created for arbitrary files looks like this:

~~~javascript
request: {
    method: 'GET'
},
response: {
    headers: {
        'content-type': mime.getType(forMockPath)
    },
    body: data
}
~~~

* Please note that this does not attempt to limit matching a request by an `Accepts` request header.

#### Function mocks

A `Function` mock takes an `options` argument with `url`, `location`, `request`, and `response` properties.

+ `url` - the `url.parse()`d `request.url`
+ `location` - the relative filesystem path where the mock definition was found. The can sometimes be useful because `Function` mocks can match for any path *under* their own.
+ `request` - a standard [Node http `request` `IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage)
+ `response` - a standard [Node http `response`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse)

A `Function` mock is the most flexible but least defined type of mock definition. At its simplest it looks something like this:

~~~javascript
module.exports = function ({ request: req, response: res }) {
    res.write('a function module');
    res.end();
};
~~~

If a `Function` mock returns an `Array` with the string `next` as it's first element Satire will continue look for mocks. Otherwise it will assume that the mock matched and handled the request.

The [`test/mocks/`](./test/mocks) directory contains a number of examples of this type of mock

+ [`a-fn-module/`](./test/mocks/a-fn-module/index.js) - the simple function module described above
+ [`post-file/`](./test/mocks/post-file/index.js) - a function module that saves a posted file to it's directory. This is used to test filesystem watching. It isn't at all secure; don't just copy and paste it.
+ [`slow-echo/`](./test/mocks/slow-echo/index.js) - reads a header from the request to determine a timeout after which it will respond with the request headers and body.
+ [`throws/`](./test/mocks/throws/index.js) - this one just throws an error. It's useful to testing error handling.

`Function` mocks take precedence over any files in subdirectories under them, allowing the function mock to define how such files are accesed.

#### Mock Descriptors

A mock descriptor is an object with ONLY `request` and `response` properties. The `request` property contains a predicate against which the incoming request is matched.

The `request` predicate is compared against the request using these rules:

+ Descend in to `Objects`. All keys defined in the predicate must match.
+ All items in an `Array` must match
+ Regular Expressions use [`RegExp.test()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/RegExp/test)
+ Functions should return `true` or `false`
+ All other types must be exactly equal

The request to be matched is a standard [Node http `request` `IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage). The predicate may match the `url` as a `String` or a parsed [URL object](https://nodejs.org/api/url.html#url_legacy_urlobject).


The `response` object describes the response, including `headers`, `statusCode`, `statusMessage`, `timeToRespond`, and `body`.

An example mock descriptor looks like this:

~~~javascript
{
    request: {
        method: /GET|POST/i,
        headers: [
            ({ accept }) => /json/.test(accept),
            ({ authorization }) => /^Bearer\s/.test(authorization),
        ]
    },
    response: {
        headers: {
            "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        statusCode: 200,
        body: {
            imaginary: true,
            value: 2
        }
    }
}
~~~

#### JSON mocks

A `.json` file will be read and parsed from the filesystem. If it contains a "mock descriptor" it will be treated as such (see [`./test/mocks/json/test-req-res.json`](./test/mocks/json/test-req-res.json) for an example.) Otherwise, the parsed `Object` will be returned directly as the mock API response since it is, by definition, capable of being `JSON.stringify()`ed. An exmple can be seen in [`./test/mocks/json/test.json`](./test/mocks/json/test.json).

#### Arrays of mocks

Sometimes you want to handle multiple types of requests at the same URI, diferentiating requests by method, headers, cookies, etc. An `Array` mock allows you to create a mock definition for each of these scenarios. The first mock definition in the array that matches will be used.
